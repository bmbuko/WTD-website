                <h2>Organic fruits</h2>
                <p>1. Apples
                    They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away…well, maybe not if it’s a conventional apple. Apples
                    are number one on the Environmental Working Group’s “Dirty Dozen” list, meaning they’re the most
                    heavily sprayed with pesticides. According to the analysis, 99 percent of apple samples, after
                    washing, tested positive for at least one pesticide residue. The pesticides sprayed on apples, such
                    as Syngenta‘s Paraquat have been associated with developing Parkinson’s disease and is banned in the
                    EU. Other pesticides such as Chlorpyrifos can damage the nervous system. Organic apples won’t break
                    the bank so it’s definitely a good idea to make the switch to organic as soon as you can.

                    2. Strawberries
                    Strawberries are a beloved fruit and since they’re so delicate and soft, they’re often prone to
                    fungi attack. For this reason, farmers usually spray fungicide on them. Forty-five other pesticide
                    residues are also found on strawberries and some have been researched to be carcinogenic, hormone
                    disruptive, neurotoxic and toxic to honey bees. Strawberries are one of summertime’s most refreshing
                    fruit and organic strawberries can also be quite pricey. If you can’t find fresh organic
                    strawberries, look for cheaper organic frozen ones.</p>

                <h2>Organic vegetables</h2>
                <p>3. Celery
                    Many people think that celery doesn’t do much in the nutrition department but it does pack quite a
                    fibrous punch, and it’s a phytonutrient superstar. Celery made its way onto the Dirty Dozen list
                    because it contains 64 pesticide residues, 27 of them being hormone disruptors. Choosing organic
                    celery is definitely a good idea and can be found relatively inexpensive.

                    4. Cherry Tomatoes
                    These bite-size tomatoes are excellent sources of lycopene, which is known to protect against
                    osteoporosis and prostate cancer. Cherry tomatoes are another item found on the Dirty Dozen list for
                    having 69 different pesticide residues. The majority of these pesticides are suspected to be hormone
                    disruptors, neurotoxins and toxic to reproductive health. According to the Environmental Working
                    Group, a single cherry tomato contains 13 different pesticides on it.

                    5. Cucumbers
                    Cucumbers are one of the most widely eaten fruits (yes, fruits!). According to the USDA Pesticide
                    Data Program, cucumbers contain 86 different pesticides. Many of these pesticides are known
                    carcinogens and many of them are also incredibly harmful to the environment. Conventional cucumbers
                    are also covered by a synthetic wax to protect the fruit during shipping. The wax is made up of
                    chemical contaminants so if you’re opting for non-organic cucumbers, remember to remove the skin. To
                    avoid the pesticide residues and the synthetic waxes completely, go organic.
